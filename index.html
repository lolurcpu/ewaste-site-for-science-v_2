    <h2>What is E-Waste?</h2>
    <p>Electronic waste, or e-waste, includes discarded electrical or electronic devices such as computers, mobile phones, TVs, and kitchen appliances. E-waste is the fastest-growing waste stream in the world due to rapid technological advancements and consumer demand.</p>

    <h2>Environmental Hazards of E-Waste</h2>
    <p>According to the <strong>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</strong>, e-waste contains harmful substances such as lead, mercury, cadmium, and flame retardants. If improperly handled, these toxins can contaminate soil, groundwater, and air, posing serious environmental and health risks.</p>

    <h2>Health Impacts from Informal Recycling</h2>
    <p>Informal recycling in developing countries often involves unsafe practices like open-air burning and acid baths. These processes release toxic chemicals into the environment, exposing workers and nearby residents to severe health issues. Research published in <strong>PubMed</strong> highlights increased levels of DNA damage, respiratory illnesses, and neurotoxicity among workers exposed to e-waste.</p>

    <h2>Current Recycling Rates and the Global Crisis</h2>
    <p>Despite global awareness, only <strong>about 20%</strong> of e-waste is properly recycled. The rest is dumped in landfills or processed through unsafe, informal methods.</p>
    <p>According to the <strong>United Nations University (UNU)</strong>, over 53.6 million metric tonnes of e-waste were generated globally in 2019, and that number is expected to exceed 74 million tonnes by 2030.</p>

    <h2>What You Can Do</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Find Certified Recyclers:</strong> Use recycling centers certified by R2 or e-Stewards to ensure environmentally responsible processing.</li>
        <li><strong>Participate in Take-Back Programs:</strong> Brands like Apple, Dell, and Best Buy offer programs to return used electronics for recycling.</li>
        <li><strong>Donate Working Devices:</strong> Many charities and schools accept functional devices for reuse, reducing demand for new production.</li>
        <li><strong>Spread Awareness:</strong> Educate friends and family about the dangers of improper disposal and the benefits of responsible recycling.</li>
        <li><strong>Check Local Laws:</strong> Some states and cities offer special e-waste collection days or have regulations for disposal.</li>
    </ul>
